AI and Data Science • Python, LangChain, Flask/Django, Frontend

Hi! I build practical AI and data solutions—from retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to web apps—focused on clear UX and measurable results. Currently exploring local/open-source LLMs and robust retrieval pipelines.

## About me
- Python-focused developer with experience in data analysis and applied AI.  
- Comfortable across the stack: notebooks to APIs to simple frontends.  
- Interested in healthcare and operations workflows where AI adds real value.  

## Skills
- Languages: Python  
- Data: pandas, matplotlib  
- AI/LLM: LangChain, RAG patterns (chunking/overlap, embeddings, retrieval)  
- Web: Flask, Django (basic), HTML/CSS/JS (frontend)  
- Tools: Git, GitHub, notebooks

## Featured projects
### AI Doctor Appointment System
End-to-end scheduling assistant that streamlines patient appointment booking with a simple web interface. Includes form validation, availability logic, and clear UX for confirmations.  
- Stack: Python, Flask/Django (choose one), HTML/CSS/JS  
- Highlights: clean routing, input handling, simple persistence layer  
- Repo: (add link) • Demo: (add link or GIF)  

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
RAG pipeline that ingests documents, chunks with overlap, embeds, and retrieves context for grounded answers.  
- Stack: Python, LangChain, Chroma/FAISS (choose one)  
- Highlights: document loaders, chunking strategy, retriever config, prompt templates  
- Repo: (add link) • Demo/Notebook: (https://github.com/manavkhatiwada/langchain-rag-starter.git)

### Hospital Management System
Basic hospital operations web app for patients, doctors, and appointments; demonstrates CRUD, simple auth, and data views.  
- Stack: Python, Flask/Django (choose one), SQLite/PostgreSQL  
- Highlights: modular structure, forms, templates, basic RBAC  
- Repo: (add link) • Screenshots: (https://github.com/manavkhatiwada/pocket-doctor-2nd)

## Currently building
- Hardening a LangChain-based RAG starter with clear ingestion and evaluation steps.  
- Evaluating local LLMs (e.g., Ollama) for privacy-first use cases.
